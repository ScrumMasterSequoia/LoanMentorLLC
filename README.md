Loan Mentor LLC is a company which does not exist. It is a theorhetical entity which only exists within this project. No license or contact with the companies herein have been made. To that end, it is for practice and will be put into effect one day maybe. 
The project is designed to help people make informed decisions about which loan types they may need for their given purpose, and for the creator, (sequoia) to theorhetically make money as an affiliate, should the affiliate link be used by a customer to take out a loan. This would be a for-profit company if it was a finished project that had been approved by the companies herein, however no effort has been made to move in that direction (yet, if ever).
The project has several features which include:
* dropdown menu with working links to all pages/subpages
* color theme with dark and light color modes for user friendliness and fun building the project. (I prefer to do everything in dark mode).
* Bios for each company with pros, cons, and special attributes for each.
* loan questionnaire, which asks the user a series of questions in order to narrow down their search parameters so they do not have to do the research necessary to make the informed decisions. Some companies will simply not offer the loan type that you need, or may have different credit score requirements for example. This is not fully fuctional, as the gathering of data is not yet implemented.
* within the questionnaire there are: (buttons only show when appropriate)
-  various options the user can select
- next button, which moves to the next question
- previous button
- restart button, which puts you back to the beginning and erases your response data
- submit button which needs added functionnality
